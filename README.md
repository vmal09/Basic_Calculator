# Basic_Calculator

Create a simple command-line calculator application in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, C#, Java). The application should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. The project should include the following features:

1. Arithmetic Operations:
   •  Users should be able to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   •  The application should perform the selected operation and display the result.

2. User Interface:
   •  Use a simple command-line interface to take user input and display results.
   •  Provide clear instructions and options for performing calculations.

3. Error Handling:
   •  Implement error handling to handle invalid user input (e.g., entering non-numeric values, dividing by zero).

4. Bonus Features (Optional):
   •  Allow users to perform additional operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
   •  Implement a history feature that records previous calculations.
