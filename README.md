# Basic_Calculator

Create a simple command-line calculator application in a programming language of your choice (e.g., Python, C#, Java). The application should allow users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers. The project should include the following features:

1. Arithmetic Operations:
   • Users should be able to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
   • The application should perform the selected operation and display the result.

2. User Interface:
   • Use a simple command-line interface to take user input and display results.
   • Provide clear instructions and options for performing calculations.

3. Error Handling:
   • Implement error handling to handle invalid user input (e.g., entering non-numeric values, dividing by zero).

4. Bonus Features (Optional):
   • Allow users to perform additional operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
   • Implement a history feature that records previous calculations.

# C++ Calculator

## Description

This is a simple command-line calculator implemented in C++. It allows users to perform various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square rooting, and exponentiation. The calculator also keeps a history of calculations made during the session.

## Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before running the calculator, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/vmal09/Basic_Calculator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the code using your C++ compiler.
   For example, using g++:

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to select the desired operation and provide input when prompted.

5. You can perform calculations, view calculation history, and exit the program when you are done.



### Available Operations

- 1: Addition
- 2: Subtraction
- 3: Multiplication
- 4: Division
- 5: Square
- 6: Square Root
- 7: Exponentiation
- 8: Show Calculation History
- 9: Exit

## Additional Information

- This program includes input validation to ensure that you enter valid numeric values and handles potential errors such as division by zero, negative square roots, and invalid input.
- Calculation history is stored in memory during the program's execution. When you exit the program, the history is not saved to a file and will be lost.

## Programming Language

- C++
